	<I>The Pilot House</I>
	<p>The Pilot House is a restaurant in my hometown, Kennebunk Maine. I worked here for three years and it was perhaps one of the most interesting experiences of my life. I worked as a line cook/dishwasher which taught me a lot of valuable things but what taught me the most were the people I worked with, including the customers. The Pilot House was a local restaurant/bar so I began to get to know the locals quite well. Most of them were fishermen or vocational workers but they all had one thing in common, they like to drink and they like to do it every day at the Pilot House. Talking to these people gave me a better idea of what the world is like than I had before because I lived a very different life than these people. On top of the interesting regulars, I worked with a man who taught me just about everything that you won't learn in school and that your parents really should not teach you. I can't say exactly what he did or who he knew, but what I can say is that I will probably never experience many of the things that he did. I could easily write a book about my experience at the Pilot House but all I have to say for now is that it was one of the most rewarding jobs I've ever worked.</p>

	<I>Sunday River</I>
	<p>Sunday River is a ski resort in Newry, Maine. I have skied there for as long as I can remember and eventually I ended up working at the mountain as a ski instructor. I only worked here for two winters because the job wasn't exactly the right fit for me. As a ski instructor, I had a group of about eight kids each year. The first year it was all girls and they were all either six or seven years old. The second year I had a mix of boys and girls and they were all either seven or eight. The job sounded like it would be a great time but I began to realize I was just a glorified baby-siiter.</p>

	<I>Wells Ocean Rescue</I>
	<p>So far, I have only worked one summer at Wells beach as a lifeguard but I plan on returning for more. Working at Wells beach was a great time, I basically got paid to sit on the beach, tan, and swim all day. I also learned a lot through this job due to training that was required and also some actual experiences where I had to apply what I was taught. The worst thing that I had to deal with on the beach was when a boy around the age of thirteen collapsed in front of me and passed out from hypothermic shock. Myself and a few other lifeguards responded to it and were able to get him off the beach and into an ambulance as quickly as possible, it was definitely rewarding when we saw how thankful the mother was. I would give this job a solid 9.5/10.</p>
