	<body>

	<p>In my immediate family there are four people. There is myself, my mother, my father, and my younger brother. Also in the house we have two dogs who we consider to be part of the family as well. Both of my grandparents on my mother's side are alive and well and we are very close with them and they remain quite active in my life.</p>

	<I>Brother</I>
	<p>My brother's name is Hayden but we call him Blue $trip because he likes money and there is a blue strip on the new hundred dollar bills. He was born three years after me, making me the oldest. Blue $trip plays a fairly important role in my life because we are very similar people and get along quite well. Shoutout to Blue $trip.</p>

	<I>Mother</I>
	<p>My mother is a very interesting woman and is someone who I look up to. Her name is Nicole and she is the Vice President of Finance and Administration at the University of New England. My mom has done a lot of very good things for the school and has effectively turned it around and improved it in every way she possibly could. She has published an article in <i>The Business Officer</i> and has done numerous podcasts for NACUBO (National Association of College and University Business Officers) where she is on the board and is also the vice chair for EACUBO (Eastern Association of college and University Business Officers). So, throughout my entire life my mother has been doing all these really neat things in the business world which I think inspired me to pursue a career in business.</p>

	<i>Father</i>
	<p>My father is also a very interesting person. His name is Paul and I don't really know exactly what he does for work. I know he works at James Hardie Building Products, which is a company that sells fiber cement siding, and he used to be a salesman and now I think he runs the supply chain on the east coast or at least something along those lines. He has come a very long way considering that he grew up in a less than fortunate situation. My father made the most of the way he grew up and overcame a lot of challenges and got to where he is today through a lot of hard work and an incredible work ethic, I admire him.</p>

	<i>My Dogs</i>
	<p>I have two dogs, Lincoln and Bode. Lincoln is a yellow lab and is somewhere around six years old. He's a beautiful dog and doesn't do anything except for lay down on his bed and eat, but we love him anyways. We do not know what Bode is, we have brought him to many different vets and no one knows what kind of dog he is. He is absolutely crazy and is full of energy all the time, 10/10 great dog.</p>

	<I>Grandparents</I>
	<p>My grandparents are very involved in my life and I am very fortunate to have them around. Their names are Roger and Louise but we call them Memere and Pepere to honor french roots. They were both high school teachers and retired around the age of fifty so  their hobbies include gardening, cleaning, and cooking. Great people.</p>
