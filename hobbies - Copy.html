	<i>Skiing</i>
	<p>Skiing is something that I have done my whole life, I started when I was about five years old and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. I raced with Gould Academy Competition Program at Sunday River for several years and then started racing for my high school. I had a lot of success with high school racing and became captain my senior year. I am joining the alpine ski club here at Umaine and am looking forward to being able to continue skiing.</p>

	<I>Other Stuff</I>
	<p>In the off season, when I'm not busy skiing, I like to spend my time doing a number of activities. These activities include, but are not limited to; spending time with friends, bird watching, rock-skipping, and tree climbing. Wow, I love the great outdoors.</p>
